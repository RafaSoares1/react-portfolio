					After five years in the tourism industry, I realized a professional void that fueled my desire for greater challenges, growth, and fulfillment. <br /> This quest led me to the dynamic realm of programming, where my practical problem-solving skills and critical thinking are put to the test daily. Currently pursuing a Software Engineering degree at 42 Porto, I possess proficiency in languages such as C, C++, Java, and Python.<br />  A quick learner with adaptability, I am committed to contributing to innovative teams and eager to leverage my skills for impactful contributions in software development.
